# Project: Absolut3D

# Summary
  The project for the reconstruction of the human body by video. Creation of a 3d person model is performed using photogrammetry 
algorithms. To use these algorithms, the open source AliceVision library (https://github.com/alicevision/AliceVision) was taken and 
the python API was created to run this library. The UNet deep neural network model for semantic image segmentation was also 
implemented and trained. The results of the neural network are used for the model optimization algorithm.

# Tech Stack
