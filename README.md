# Project: Absolut3D

# Summary
    The project for the reconstruction of the human body by video. Creation of a 3d person model is performed using photogrammetry \ algorithms. To use these algorithms, the open source AliceVision library (https://github.com/alicevision/AliceVision) was taken and the \ python API was created to run this library. The UNet deep neural network model for semantic image segmentation was also implemented and \ trained. The results of the neural network are used for the model optimization algorithm. \
